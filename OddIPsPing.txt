# This PowerShell script scans a specified subnet range by pinging only the IP addresses that end in odd numbers. Designed for network diagnostics, it iterates through a defined IP range, pings each odd-numbered IP once, and stores the results in a text file. Each result logs the IP address along with its reachability status.
