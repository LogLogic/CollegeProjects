Odd IP Address Ping Scanner

This PowerShell script scans a specified subnet range by pinging only the IP addresses that end in odd numbers. 
Designed for network diagnostics, it iterates through a defined IP range, pings each odd-numbered IP once, 
and stores the results in a text file. Each result logs the IP address along with its reachability status.

Features:

Selective IP Scanning: Targets only odd-numbered IPs within the range.
Automated Reachability Testing: Uses Test-Connection to ping addresses, making it ideal for quick network health checks.
Logging to File: Saves ping results to ping.txt, providing a straightforward reference for network diagnostics.
